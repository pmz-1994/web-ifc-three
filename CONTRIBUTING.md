# Topics

Here's some stuff we need help on:

### Docs

* New tutorials of web-ifc-three in the [official documentation](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Guide/web-ifc-three/Introduction).

### Performance

* Our current implementation of geometry merges everything into a single buffer. Using [instancing](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_instancing_performance) would consume much less memory and perform better.

### Testing and CI/CD
* We are setting up the tests for this project right now. You can help us make the tests better, add new tests, etc. 
* Automate PR check, deploy, versioning, etc with github actions.


This list is pretty big, but not at all complete, there's much more things that could be improved!
If you need help getting started come find us in the [discord channel](https://discord.gg/FXfyR4XrKT).

If you have an idea that's not on the list, please tell us about it so we can discuss if we want it in the repo.

# Process

We don't really have a fixed process yet, so don't worry to much. Just make sure we know what you're doing :)

Whenever you're ready, make a PR with a good name. We will take a look asap.

Thanks!
